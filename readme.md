    * Add your d-id api key to the `api.json` file in you prject directory

* Consult with ChatGPT or your favorite model -- they all know nore then I do :)
* Ask human assistance try Discord as all these packages have servers with helpful people on them

# Starting the Software:
* From you project directory and session where you installed Node and ran npm install express in step #3
* start up the backend server by running node app.js
* You should see this message - server started on port localhost:3001
* (open index.html app) in the browser add http://localhost:3001/index.html
* (connect button) press connect you should see the connection ready fedback on bottom of screen
* The looping Avatar video should play waitig for your question
* Clear all the check boxes and test that you can chat with your Ollama Model only (No check for Did Avatar)
* Now check the box for a voice replay (Still without D-ID check box) to test voice playback
* Once Ollama and you LLM are chatting via text then test voice typing to see if your browser is set up correctly
* Now you are ready to Check the box to send to D-ID (Press the connect button to set up streaming conmnections)
* Input a Chat and the D-ID service will animate the response. 

## Final Thoughts
* Be patient and enjoy the puzzle if things are not working right away -- stay with it you will get it!
